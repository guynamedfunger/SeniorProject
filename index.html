        <p>description/activities</p>
        <p>Something cool about art is that there's a lot you can use for a piece of work. Whatever resources
            you need ultimately depend on what medium you'll be using.
            <br>These are some examples:
            <br><br>In traditional (term for non-digital) art people sometimes incorporate objects into the piece
            itself, a cool example I saw once was the tops of coca-cola bottles glued onto a canvas. It's common to
            reuse trash or scraps. I've used scraps of fabric in the past.
            <br><br>For painting (oil/acrylic), most often you'll need a canvas, paintbrushes, and the paint itself.
            You'll also need a surface to mix paints on. For oil paint you'll need paint thinner.
            <br><br>For sketching, you'll need something to sketch with (a pen, pencil, anything that makes a mark) and
            something to sketch on. Most commonly paper is used.
            <br><br>For digital you'll need some type of device, often a tablet is used, and a drawing software.
            Sometimes the softwares is free, sometimes you'll need a subscription.
            <br><br>Evaluating what you'll need depends on whatever medium you want to use and how you want the image to
            look and feel.
            <br><br>My personal favorite method is digital painting and drawing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have a few goals in mind while creating. First, I like to believe art should be made for oneself firstly,
            in whatever way that might mean to someone. For me, that means I am enjoying creating whatever it is I am
            making and that I'm proud of it. I love creating so I am usually enjoying myself when making something. As
            for having pride, I often have doubt in myself, but the more I create, the better I get at creating. Knowing
            that motivates me a lot.
            <br><br>Secondly, I wish to reach something called "flow". Flow is when you get so engrossed into a task
            time does not matter. I picked this concept up from my Theory of Knowledge class. It applies to many things 
            but a good example is digging into a good book. That goes hand-in-hand with the first task, but when I reach 
            "flow" is usually when I'm most expressive and creative with my art. It can also be pretty relaxing 
            or it can hype me up a lot. Depends on what I'm making.
            <br><br>Third, I wish to convey certain moods or messages in my art. It can be something deep or a
            means of self expression - or as simple as "it looks cool" and "it makes me laugh." It doesn't always have
            to be so serious.
            <br><br>Fourth, I strive to always improve. And again, the more I create, the better my work gets. It's all
            practice, research, and feedback that helps me. I love getting feedback from my friends. What also helps me
            is taking the media that I like and getting little sparks of inspiration from that. Certain ways of
            brainstorming also help, strategies such as association and mixing things together to see whatever comes out
            are quite handy.

        <h3 id="S2">My History</h3>
        <p>I started drawing ever since I could hold a pencil. I wasn't any good at it, as the hand-eye coordination of
            baby me wasn't great (It's still not great but I've improved a lot!), but I still was supported luckily. I
            was
            mostly interested in fictional creatures such as dragons and phoenixes. Sometimes I'd draw cats too. I
            avoided humans as I didn't find them easy to draw. I started uploading my drawings online very early in my
            life, a little before I turned 13. At this point in my life I was a "furry", so I drew animals mostly. I
            can't remember before 14 too well, but I knew I had multiple art apps, some of which held online
            communities. I
            was a part of these communities for a while and made a few online friends on them, a few of whom I still
            speak
            to as I'm 17. I made animation memes when I was a teenager and uploaded those on youtube alongside another
            friend I had in real life. One website I do remember often visiting was Deviantart, though this was a little
            after my animation meme phase (I still liked animation memes, just not to the same degree). It was around
            this
            time I started to learn basic concepts like color composition, the color wheel, shapes and the like. I
            started becoming interested in painting around 15-16
            and joined a painting class at Hellgate during grade 11. That's when my interest in art started to grow
            exponentially and I started taking it more seriously. I picked up traditional painting quick as I already
            knew how to paint digitally fairly well. I started to become more interested in scenery, but still had some
            interest in characters. Last semester of this year I was in printmaking, where I experimented with my style
            and dabbled in mixed media. At this point in my life I try to not conform to social expectations and try
            to do my own thing, which in turn showed in my art with my experimentation. Part of that was testing out
            my style and themes in my work and character designs.
            <br><br>Currently, I love to mess around with my art and my interest lay mostly in scenery, symbolism, and
            characters. I want to keep messing around with colors and styles and try to incorporate environmental
            storytelling into my pieces. Because I am a constantly shifting person, so is my art and I've slowly come
            to accept that as being a part of my learning process. I still occasionally post online, but only to my
            friends and not on any public accounts. The people who I have made friends with in this year, my
            highschool years, and throughout my teenage years have encouraged me to keep making art and supported my
            growth. I only hope to keep growing and improving. I couldn't be any happier with where I'm going.

        <p>STEP 1 : I start with brainstorming what themes I want to go with using simple words. I also look at inspiration while I do this. Themes/ideas I came up with (which can change down the line): Monochrome, thorns, bone, barbed wire, pixelated?, photos, cats or bats
            <br>STEP 2 : I know I'll be creating graphics for this website so I put down the colors I am already using for the website. I know the background is a darker color so the accents must be lighter colors.
            <br>STEP 3 : I list the key words I came up with on my canvas and start sketching ideas. I try concepts by themselves as well as combined concepts.
            <br>STEP 4 : I pick my favorite sketches and narrow it down to two of each graphics I want (dividers & little symbols).
            <br>STEP 5 : I start with a messy base.

        <p>I have had many influences on my art but I feel like I have a handful who have been the most impactful. This

        <h3>A Brief History of Digital Art</h3>
        <p>The history of digital art is a little ambiguous. The first drawing program was created in 1963 by Ivan 
            Sutherland, which was called Sketchpad. A pen called a light pen was used to create lines on the screen 
            of a computer. It was innovative, allowing users to zoom in and out of drawings, similar to how drawing 
            programs can modernly. In 1974, Richard Shoup created SuperPaint. With SuperPaint, users were able to use 
            colors, manipulate those colors, and animate. The ways you could adjust colors on SuperPaint was with sliders 
            that affected saturation, hue, and brightness. This system is still used in graphic software. In 1984 the 
            Macintosh was released, the first personal computers. The PCs came with a drawing program called MacPaint. 
            MacPaint was the first experience of average people creating digital drawings and paintings. A year later 
            Microsoft Paint was released. In 1990 Adobe Photoshop released which could mimic brushstrokes, though it was 
            used primarily for photo editing. With updates it has been able to keep up and is still used by many people 
            modernly. Art apps and programs such as Procreate, ibisPaint X, and Clip Studio Paint were released in the 
            early 2000's and have only improved since then. People are even able to make their own digital brushes 
            now (some of which look super realistic).</p>

        <h3>Worldwide Connection</h3>
        <p>As corny as it might sound, there's been connections between humans and art since the beginning of time.
            There is art over 9,000 years old where people have come together and left a mark on the world,
            saying, "I'm here. We've been here." The cave art at Cueva de las Manos is exactly that.</p>
        <img src="cdlm.jpg" alt="Many hands stincled at the Cueva de las Manos (Cave of Hands)">
        <p><i>"Cave of the Hands"</i></p>
        <p>Art is saying without words. It can be a tool, a weapon, a hobby, entertainment, political, and a way to 
            communicate and express oneself. With the advancements of technology, that art is more easily accessible 
            and easier to share.
            The internet has let me be myself in a way real life hasn't allowed for a long, long time. With the
            progression of society and having more freedom at 17 I get to express myself more but still isn't the same.
            Online I get to be freely LGBTQ+ and I get to unmask my autism just a little more than in real life.
            I get to feel my emotions online. I know several people who have experiences similar to mine in that regard. 
            Montana isn't exactly the safest place to do all of that. As someone who was raised with the internet, I am
            incredibly lucky I get to spread my art online and find connections with people similar to myself, even if 
            they live miles away.</p>
